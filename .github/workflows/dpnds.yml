# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Perform dependency analysis
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # To use this repository's private action,
      # you must check out the repository
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Depends analysis step
        uses: ./ # Uses an action in the root directory
        id: depends
        with:
          language: 'java'
      # Use the output from the `hello` step
      - name: Depends result
        run: echo "The result of the analysis was ${{ steps.depends.outputs.result }}"
